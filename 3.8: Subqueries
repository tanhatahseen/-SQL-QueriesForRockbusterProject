1. To find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers: 

SELECT 
   AVG(total_amount_paid.total_payment) AS average_payment
FROM 
(SELECT 
 c.customer_id,
 c.first_name,
 c.last_name, 
 country.country AS country,
 ct.city AS city,
 SUM(p.amount) AS total_payment
FROM payment p INNER JOIN customer c ON p.customer_id=c.customer_id
INNER JOIN address a
ON c.address_id=a.address_id
INNER JOIN city ct ON a.city_id=ct.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON ct.country_id=country.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni','Dhule 
(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo' )
GROUP BY c.customer_id,c.first_name,c.last_name,country,city
ORDER BY total_payment DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid



2. Finding out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country: 

SELECT 
   all_customers.country,
   COUNT(DISTINCT all_customers.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
   COUNT(DISTINCT top_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM 
(SELECT 
 c.customer_id,
 country.country AS country
FROM customer c INNER JOIN address a
ON c.address_id=a.address_id
INNER JOIN city ct ON a.city_id=ct.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON ct.country_id=country.country_id
) AS all_customers 
INNER JOIN 
(SELECT 
 c.customer_id,
 c.first_name,
 c.last_name, 
 country.country AS country,
 ct.city AS city,
 SUM(p.amount) AS total_payment
FROM payment p INNER JOIN customer c ON p.customer_id=c.customer_id
INNER JOIN address a
ON c.address_id=a.address_id
INNER JOIN city ct ON a.city_id=ct.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON ct.country_id=country.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni','Dhule 
(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo' )
GROUP BY c.customer_id,c.first_name,c.last_name,country,city
ORDER BY total_payment DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_customers

ON all_customers.country=top_customers.country
GROUP BY all_customers.country
