# Project Brief 

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the                
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

After loading all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS), SQL queries were used to analyze the data and answer the
ad-hoc business questions below: 

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
