# Project Brief 

After loading all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS), SQL queries were used to analyze the data and answer the
ad-hoc business questions below: 

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
